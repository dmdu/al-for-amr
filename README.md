# Active Learning for AMR

This project includes data Jupyter notebooks for analysis of performance of Active Learning techniques applied to Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) simulations. Specifially, we consider AMR simulations of a shock-bubble interaction phenomenon. We train and evaluate Active Learning algorithms on the data from AMR simulation runs performed on Edison supercomputer at NERSC (US National Energy Research Computing Center).
